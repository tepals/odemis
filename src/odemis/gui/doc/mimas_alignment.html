        <h5>Overview MIMAS alignment</h5>
        <font size="2">
        <ol>
            In this tab, it is possible to align the FIB and Optical lens to a single coincidence point.
            The alignment is split in two sections:
        </ol>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Aligning the sample stage to the coincidence height of the FIB</li>
            <li>Moving the objective stage to align the FLM view to the FIB coincidence point</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h5>Alignment instructions</h5>
        <font size="2">
        <ol>
            In this section, the coincidence plane of the FIB is determined by setting the correct sample stage Z coordinate.
            At the correct sample stage Z, a selected feature will line up vertically (on the same horizontal line) in FIB image.
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <li>To avoid any drift in Z axis, wait until the temperature of the Cryo sample holder has been stabilized</li>
            <li>Move the stage Z to a fixed position corresponding to a Z that gives a good alignment range for the beam shift</li>
            <li>Move the stage X and Y to a position on a grid which has no use (because the procedure will damage it)
                Possibly, this is done in the FIB stream. (it’s possible to move the stage even if the optical image is not playing)</li>
            <li>Play the optical stream using widefield</li>
            <li>Focus optical using the objective lens Z</li>
            <li>Switch to FIB mode</li>
            <li>Select a FIB imaging preset (ie, 100pA ion beam current)</li>
            <li>Set FIB horizontal field width to 30µm</li>
            <li>Focus FIB</li>
            <li>FIB makes a surface hole at the center of its FoV (~1s)</li>
            <li>Switch to Optical mode</li>
            <li>Acquire a new optical image, and locate the (new) hole</li>
            <li>Move the stage in X,Y, to have the hole at the center of the optical FoV</li>
            <li>Switch to FIB mode</li>
            <li>Activate the FIB imaging</li>
            <li>Adjust the beam shift so that it's at the center of the FoV. (Note: from the stage move, it should be possible to have a very good guess of the beam shift needed)</li>
            <li>Store the beam shift</li>
            <li>Repeat previous step 16 and 17 for every preset(ie, ion beam current)</li>
        </ol>
